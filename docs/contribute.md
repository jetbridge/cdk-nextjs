# Contribute
Hey there, we value every new contribution. Thank you! üôèüèº

## Installation
1. `git clone https://github.com/jetbridge/cdk-nextjs.git`
2. `pnpm i`

## Contribution Workflow
1. Create an issue first describing bug/feature request. If feature request that you want to implement, please verify with maintainers before working on PR to make sure we're all on same page.
2. Link the bug in your pull request.
3. Run `pnpm build` after you made your changes and before you open a pull request.

## Projen
This project uses [Projen](https://projen.io/). Don't manually update package.json or use `pnpm add`. Update dependencies in .projenrc.ts then run `pnpm projen`.

## JSII Struct Builder
When you want to reuse interfaces/structs from the AWS CDK library and customize them so all of their properties are optional, you cannot simply use the TypeScript utility type, [Partial](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype), because of the TypeScript [limitations](https://aws.github.io/jsii/user-guides/lib-author/typescript-restrictions/#typescript-mapped-types) of JSII. To solve this problem, this construct library uses [@mrgrain/jsii-struct-builder](https://github.com/mrgrain/jsii-struct-builder) to generate partial types. These types are defined in the .projenrc.ts files (you'll need to scroll down to see them) and are primarily used in `NextjsOverrides`. They files are in the src/generated-structs folder.

## Bootstrap Issue
`@mrgrain/jsii-struct-builder` is also used to generate optional structs of code within this repository (`OptionalNextjsBucketDeploymentProps`, etc.). In order for `@mrgrain/jsii-struct-builder` to read the source code struct to create a generate struct with optional properties, the JSII assembly must exist. If you simply run `projen build` this would fail because the JSII assembly of the source code hasn't been created yet. We can get around this issue by running `projen compile` first to create the JSII assembly, then `projen build` to use `@mrgrain/jsii-struct-builder` to create the optional version of the struct. The `.projenrc.ts` patches the build GitHub Workflow and Job to compile then build. See more [here](https://github.com/mrgrain/jsii-struct-builder/issues/174#issuecomment-1850496788).
